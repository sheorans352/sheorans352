- 👋 Hi, I’m Sunil
- 👀 I’m working in Digital Marketing and interested in ML and writing codes. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to write and use case-specific Python codes and ML to see how clearly a larger data set can produce a bigger picture. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making AI and programming used at workplaces/service outlets/products where the skill gaps make it harder to be an early adopter.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I love photography and am a commerce student.
