- 👋 Hi, I’m Sunil
- 👀 I’m working in Digital Marketing, and I am interested in ML and writing codes. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to write and use case-specific Python codes and ML to see how clear a bigger picture a larger data set can produce. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making AI and programming to be used at workplaces/service outlets/products where the skill gaps make it harder to be an early adoptor. 
- 📫 How to reach me: sheorans352@gmail.com (A website coming up soon!)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love photography and am a commerce student.
